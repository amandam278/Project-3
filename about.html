            <h1>Hi! My name is Amanda.</h1>

            <p> Hi! My name is Amanda Mazur and I am from Lolo, Montana. I attended Sentinel High School where I was the head of 
                the executive board of HOSA: Future Health Professionals, a member of Student Government, and a committee member 
                through Key Club International. In High School, I also worked as an office manager for my dads chiropractic business
                 and lived with my grandpa to take care of him. My family, friends, and community are significant parts of my life. 
                 I love volunteering with optimistic kids who dream big. I volunteer teaching art at Zootown Art Community Center,
                  tutoring kids at Lewis and Clark Elementary, and coaching Missoula Youth Track. In my free time, you can find me
                   hiking Missoula's trails, playing the piano, and dreaming of traveling the world, specifically Eastern Europe. </p>
            </br>

                <p>I am currently a freshman at the University of Montana studying Art and Business Administration. 
                    My passion is painting with acrylics and watercolors. In the future, I hope to start a non-profit for art
                     education that empowers underrepresented students to know they have a voice and a safe place to be heard,
                      as well as the resources and education to use that voice. I am involved in the Honors Student Association 
                      and the University of Montana Entertainment Management Club.
